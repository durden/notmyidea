    <h1>About Not My Idea</h1>

    <p>
        A developer's github profile can tell you a lot about the things their
        interested in and what their capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another good bit of information to know about a developer is how
        willing they are to contribute to projects/ideas that are not their
        own.
